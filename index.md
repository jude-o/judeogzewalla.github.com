Navigation Bar {#Navigation_Bar}

The navigation bar on the left contains links to both job-specific and
administrative tools including supporting items such as documents, user
and device information, and container layout. Also, when you are working
in a job, the job name will be displayed at the top of the menu for easy
reference.

As you navigate to different pages, page-specific menu items will become
available. Menu items are collapsible under the main headers of Job,
Main, and Tools. Click the header to expand the list of available
options or tools. Click the header again to collapse it.

When you enter ContentsTrack, the available headers are the Main header
and the Tools header. The Main and Tools headers are expanded by
default. The Job header will appear when you select a job from the Jobs
page.

When you select a job, the Job header will automatically expand and the
Main and Tools headers will automatically collapse. The Job header will
be available until you click on one of the options available under the
Main or Tools headers.
